2. Right-click on the `ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip` file and select "Extract All...".
3. Choose a destination folder to extract the files to (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`) and click "Extract".

## Step 3: Add FFmpeg to the System Path

1. Open the extracted folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`) and navigate to the `bin` directory.

## Step 4: Verify the Installation

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, make sure to:
- Double-check that the path to the `bin` directory is correct.
- Ensure that the path is added to the "System variables" section, not the "User variables" section.
- Restart your Command Prompt or computer to apply the changes.
